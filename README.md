# Camp Search


## Description
Camp Search is a web application used to search campsites by filtering through national parks. This web application consolidates many useful information about campsites and trails, including the weather, rating, description, and location on the map. This was done through reteriveving info from four different APIs and using technologies like React.js, Material UI, and many more. Users are also able to save their favorite campgrounds.

## Instructions
To successfully utilize this web app, simply put in a national park of interest into the search input. If the national park name entered is part of the suggested list, it will show up. After clicking enter, the website will load the campgrounds in that national park. To retreive more info on a specific campground, simply click "Learn More" to learn about the trails, the weather, rating, and descriptions. If you wish to save the campground, click on the "star", and this will save the campsite into the database. These can be seen in the "Favorities" page, which is available on the Navbar.
